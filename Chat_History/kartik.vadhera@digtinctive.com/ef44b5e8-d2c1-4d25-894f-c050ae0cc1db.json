Variables can be assigned to hosts.  Inventories can be pulled from sources like EC2.\n4. **Plugins:** Pieces of code that extend Ansible's functionality.  Examples include cache, callback, and action plugins.\n5. **Playbooks:** Guides or manuals for tasks.  These are simple YAML files that orchestrate the execution of modules on hosts.",

Therefore, I cannot name commonly used Ansible modules.\n\nSupplementing with internal knowledge:\n\nGiven we've already discussed that modules are small programs Ansible uses to control things on remote hosts, here are some commonly used ones:\n\n* **`apt`:**  Manages packages on Debian/Ubuntu systems.  You can use it to install, upgrade, remove, and search for packages.\n* **`yum`:** Similar to `apt`, but for RedHat/CentOS systems.  Handles package management on those distributions.\n* **`service`:**  Starts, stops, restarts, and checks the status of services.  Useful for managing things like web servers, databases, etc.\n* **`copy`:** Copies files from the control machine to remote hosts.  Essential for distributing configuration files, scripts, and other data.\n* **`template`:**  Similar to `copy`, but allows for templating using Jinja2.  This lets you dynamically generate configuration files based on variables.\n* **`file`:**  Manages files and directories.  You can create, delete, change permissions, and create symbolic links.\n* **`lineinfile`:**  Ensures specific lines are present (or absent) in a file.  Great for managing configuration files without replacing the entire file.\n* **`command`:** Executes a simple command on the remote host.  Useful for quick tasks or when a specific module isn't available.\n* **`shell`:**  Similar to `command`, but executes the command through a shell.  This allows for more complex commands and shell features like pipes and redirection.\n* **`setup`:** Gathers facts about the remote host, such as operating system, IP address, and hardware information.  These facts can then be used in playbooks.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list, but it covers many of the modules you'll likely use regularly.  Ansible has a vast library of modules, and you can find documentation for all of them on the Ansible website.",
