      "  \"answer\": \"Excessive internet use can lead to fatigue, eye problems, and a decline in academic performance.  It can also cause a loss of focus on traditional learning methods like in-class discussions and physical classroom learning, leading to decreased student attendance and impacting socialization and face-to-face interaction. This can negatively affect mental well-being.  Additionally, the internet facilitates plagiarism and copyright infringement, impacting academic professionals and potentially leading students to engage in careless plagiarism due to easy access to information and a lack of awareness about the consequences.
