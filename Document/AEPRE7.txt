The Internet and its complementary negative consequences

The internet, as the word says, is nothing but an international networking setup, so it has revolutionized almost every field, be it engineering, business, education, etc, and has established itself as a strong pillar for education and learning besides being an aid in countless fields. Although the internet has many advantages, it also carries some shortcomings.

The internet's surfing for a certain type of content, such as YouTube, Facebook, and other social media platforms, acts as a distraction and snatches the user's precious time, which could have been productively utilized. Because of internet's excessive use, fatigue, eye problems and other decline in academic performance.

In addition to the above, I believe the easy accessibility of the Internet also leads to a loss of focus on conventional learning methods, such as physical class learning and in-class discussion. Furthermore, educational resources readily available on the internet promote the absence of students in physical classrooms since a student abstains from going to class and prefers online/remote learning from the comfort of the home. As a result, a student misses the opportunity of socializing and face-to-face interaction, which impacts them in a negative way. They suffer from mental illnesses and their overall well-being is also compromised.
Adding to the above, in academic contexts, with the digital era making information exchange and accessibility a click away, it has given birth to a new kind of problem: copyright paradox. Internet facilitating plagiarism and copyright infringement has, therefore, created a feeling of panic in the minds of academic professionals who are very possessive and serious when it comes to their hard and researched work. 
The ease of copying content also leads to careless plagiarism among students who are broadly unaware of the professional and legal consequences and results of such malpractice.
